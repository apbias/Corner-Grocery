Summarization: This program is designed to read a file and count the frequency of each word in the file. The menu allows the user to display the total count of each word or to display a histogram of each word. The program will save a backup upon close. 

Stengths: Navigating the Map standard template Library in C++

Where could I enhance my code?: I would add more error checking to user inputs and file validations.

What pieces of code did I find challenging: Wrapping my head around the Map library class and using it to its full potential.

How did I overcome this? A lot of trial and error and debugging. Google pointed to a lot of good resource to practice using the class. 

What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?: I am adding stackoverflow and freecodecamp to my resources for further learning.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?: Critical thinking, developing solutions before I even start coding. Pseudocode and flowcharts are very helpful.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?: Its maintainable because majority of the functions are in a Class file making it easier to update the menu functions without breaking the main program. Its readable because it follows C++ style guide and has good documentation within the code.
